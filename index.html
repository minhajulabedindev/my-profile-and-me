                    <p>I am studying at the best collage in my city. I am presently in honurs 1st-year. I feel happy to
                        be a
                        part
                        of

                        I
                        have extraordinary skills in some subjects whereas I am very weak in the few.No man can do
                        anything
                        in
                        the world without aim.</p>

                    <h3>My Strengths</h3>
                    <p>The advice of my parents had a keen effect on my habits. I believe to speak the truth and try my
                        best
                        not
                        to lie. My parents always advised me that if I commit a mistake, I should admit it. I try my
                        best to
                        do
                        so. I know how to remain happy in every condition. Because I believe that: “Happiness is not out
                        there;
                        it’s in you.”</p>

                    <p>In compare to studies, I am good at sports. so I am the captain of my class football team. I am
                        the
                        best
                        football player at my school. Besides this, I am a fast runner also and I love athletics. I am
                        in
                        expert
                        swimming.The advice of my parents had a keen effect on my habits. I believe to speak the truth

                    <h3>My Weaknesses</h3>
                    <p>As every man have weaknesses, so have also. I am a little bit lazy at some places which I do not
                        like.
                        While playing time, I pass my lot of time there which is not a good habit, but I try my best to
                        overcome
                        my weaknesses.Everybody has an ambition in life. Aim or ambition is the inner aspiration of man.

                    <h3>My Ambition</h3>
                    <p>Everybody has an ambition in life. Aim or ambition is the inner aspiration of man. No man can do
                        anything
                        in the world without aim. So, all of us should be very determined about our aim in life.
                        Without good career planning, right from the start, one can’t be on the right track.One has to
                        set
                        the
                        goals.</p>

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>These are all the things which express me. Though nobody can be described in a few sets of
                        sentences.
                        One
                        needs to have yet command of oneself before going to write something about his life. Life is
                        meant
                        to be
                        lived avidly and with visualization to do good for your fellow beings. Keeping this aim in mind,
